# List of Projects
### Teas API:
    This project's goal is to learn node.js basics.
### Books List: 
    This Project displays books from a Goodreads API. 
    The goal of the project was to display multiple criterias, it doesn't edits/updates or deletes anything.
    With this project I also learn to use EJS.
